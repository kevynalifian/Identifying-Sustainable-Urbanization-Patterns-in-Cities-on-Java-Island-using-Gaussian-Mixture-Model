# Identifying Sustainable Urbanization Patterns in Cities on Jawa Island using Gaussian Mixture Model

## Description:
Rapid urbanization on the island of Java presents challenges for sustainable development, such as social inequality, environmental pressure, and economic imbalance. Previous studies have utilized clustering methods to group regions, but the results have often been suboptimal. Therefore, this study proposes the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach to cluster 119 regencies/cities on Java Island based on 18 social, economic, and ecological indicators aligned with the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) framework. The GMM model with an optimal number of clusters K=3 demonstrated the best performance compared to other methods, with a Silhouette Score of 0.3444, a Calinski–Harabasz Index of 57.1502, and a Davies–Bouldin Score of 1.4004. The clustering results identified three regional groups: developing regions with stable environments, urban centers with high urbanization pressures, and vulnerable regions facing complex challenges. This study is expected to positively contribute to the case study on Data Mining for Risk Classification and Unsustainable Urbanization from Social and Economic Data and support SDG Goal 11 through data-based urbanization risk mapping. Thus, this research contributes to the formulation of more inclusive, adaptive, and sustainable urban governance policies.
